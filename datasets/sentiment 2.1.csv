0,    Woke up this morning to the news that I too have been impacted by the layoffs DoorDash. As I am sure you all can imagine this comes as a major shock.I loved my time at DoorDash.

Woke up at 4:15am and had a feeling to check my email. 4:14am- Saw an email from Doordash on my personal email noting I was impacted by a layoff. Second one this year. Recruiting leadership has been preaching we've been doing well as a business, I guess not totally transparent with us.I want to apologize to all the candidates I'm in the process with-this is not the candidate experience I ever like to have and is not a view of how I operate.

6,    It was about 11:20 pm last night and I was working late preparing for calibrations as I wanted to represent my team to the best of my ability. It was also my first calibration at Doordash because I recently joined after being at Meta for almost 6 years. Then my access to a doc expired. I didn’t think much and simply re requested access and continued to work for another 5 mins and then I was logged out of my zoom account. Then my computer shut down. I thought this was a sign I might be over preparing and it was time for bed. But my laptop restarted and I saw that I was locked out by my administrator and needed a pin. Quickly I tried to email tech support with a screenshot and then knew something horrible may have happened as my work email rejected. I tried not to panic and wake my wife up and I had no one to reach out to this late. Then I simply prayed for peace and tried my best to fall asleep but couldn’t. I woke up to an email saying my role was eliminated due to etc etc. So many emotions I am trying to process still as my 3 young children will be waking up soon and the morning madness begins. I knew the risk when I took this role and would not have tenure which probably meant security and stability if mass layoffs happened. It’s still so tough to come to grips with as I’ve been trying my best to actively help former Meta colleagues as much as I can. My brief time at Doordash was great and believed I was making strong momentum with my team and client groups right away. I will miss working with them. I know (at least a little) the market conditions are brutal for tech recruiting let alone recruiting managers. To all who have been impacted my blessings to you and your family. Will be happy to be available and help if I can.

14,"    As a past startup founder, I know firsthand how hard it can be to recruit and hire the right talent—And after going through my first layoff experience this year, I've been thinking a lot about how companies hire. In my newest thought piece for A.Team's MISSION, I explore a new model for bringing in talent to accelerate product development while cutting fixed costs: fractional teams.

15,"    Imagine that instead of painstakingly hiring one individual at a time, you were able to hire an entire team—flexibly scaling their hours up and down based on the stage of product development you’re in.Wait… Did we just figure out a layoff-proof model for team building?Here’s the predicament: Slower growth, higher interest rates, and diminished consumer spending are forcing companies to exercise a lot more caution as they undergo their 2023 headcount planning—but they still need to build high-growth products to hit their goals.What if they designed their companies differently?Despite the current economic climate, top founders are bringing in the talent they need to accelerate product development while actually saving on costs.The secret? Instead of hiring full-time, they’re deploying fractional teams.With fractional hiring, founders can deploy a specialized, fractional team that’s already worked together before and is perfectly suited to build what they need to build, instead of painstakingly hiring individuals and forming them into a team over a 6-12 month period.If you look at the layoff messaging from the CEOs of Stripe, Meta, and Apple, they all had a common narrative: They’d gotten ahead of themselves with hiring amidst the economic boom and grew their workforce too fast.If they had instead kept a smaller core staff of FTEs and supplemented them with fractional teams based on the initiatives at hand—would the outcomes be different?Fractional teams might just be the answer to layoff-proof hiring in 2023.Read the full article: https://bit.ly/3UjUszo  ",             Certified Resume Writer - ATS | 1637+ Resumes Delivered -Globally | 400+ LinkedIn Profiles Optimized | Job Search Strategy | Clients Land their Job Interviews after my Resume Writing | Content Creator | Personal Branding         ,982,             115 comments           ,                 54 reposts

36,"    Shame on DoorDash for laying people off via email. I know they laid off a lot of people, but at least set up some Zoom meetings or something. Treat people like people.I've been thinking a lot about how many people worked hard for their employers prior to being laid off. They put in the extra hours, pushed through days packed with meetings, logged in on weekends to meet deadlines and push out offers; they rose to challenges, stepping outside their comfort zones and learning the skills needed to get the job done, and to think that after all of that, no one ""had time"" to break the news to their face? It's not okay. It's become way too easy for companies to casually, carelessly discard people like they mean nothing. We need to do better.

Jassy said that Amazon was still assessing how buyers are reacting to the current environment, but that it was ""clear (that) consumers are spending but being careful.""♦️ He also addressed the controversy around the Kyrie Irving-boosted book and film Hebrews to Negroes: Wake up Black America, confirming that it would remain for sale on Amazon, saying that moderating content for sale on Amazon “is one of the trickiest issues we deal with” and calling it a ""very slippery slope"" to make such calls ""when you have content whose primary purpose is not to espouse hate or ascribe negative characteristics to people.""♦️ Jassy seemed bullish on Amazon's long-term emerging tech bets, including Zoox, its self-driving car and Project Kuiper, its initiative to provide low-latency, high-speed broadband connectivity: ""Do I think every single one of them is gonna be successful? The history of business — the history of Amazon — suggests no... But even one of them actually becomes that fourth pillar on top of Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, then we're a different company.""#TechonLinkedIn #DealBookSummit  ",             Trust & Safety Recruiting @ DoorDash         ,129,             6 comments           ,                 2 reposts

108,"    David just escaped from a full-time job in a toxic environment where the best employees quit and the worst people were promoted to management positions. The people with all the ideas were shunned and pushed aside, while the tush-kissers with no plans got promoted.  The harder David worked, the worse he got treated. Finally, when a completely unqualified person got promoted to be his manager because that manager had a personal relationship with one of the VPs, that was the last straw; David resigned. It was hard for him to leave the company he worked so hard for, but he felt a huge weight lifted off his shoulders the minute he was out of there. I read this story from Liz Ryan’s article in Forbes, and it is so reminiscent of many people’s experiences in many organizations worldwide. Great employees, who came into the organization with an inspired heart and a spark in their eyes, ready to make a difference, got uninspired and demotivated when they soon realized that their environment was toxic to the core.  Never settle for any toxic, fear-based organization.  It’s not good for your professional development, health, and energy; there are many options out there; take advantage of them because you deserve better, and you deserve to work in an environment that helps you become the very best version of yourself.Check out more here: https://lnkd.in/ewvwKhu#leadershipfirstquotes #entrepeneurship #leadershipdevelopment #executivesandmanagement #management #leadershipfirst #giffordthomas #leadership #inspiration #motivation  ",             Catalyst – Innovation Communities & Movements | Advisor & Board Member         ,2,0,0

I saw a LinkedIn post yesterday where an individual expressed their harsh and compassionless opinion against those who were impacted by the #metalayoffs.

I’m not asking for pity or for people to feel sorry for me; for us. We are all processing. My coworkers on my team were some of the best people I have met.

Companies hired fast and loose to make up for the losses they suffered the previous year. Candidates received offers far above market price and could negotiate aggressively between several offers at a time. In 2022, the economy slammed on the brakes.Many of these layoffs are a consequence of over-leveraged companies – high salaries, high operating costs, and poor business planning from when the economy was hunky dory.But there are lots of companies out there that put away food for the winter and are still doing pretty well. In fact, some businesses are thriving in this weather because their missions are practical and continuously well-executed.If you're an individual that has been affected by any of these #layoffs , check out Odoo.

With the news today that another 20% of the company was terminated, I wanted to share a few things that helped me. 💬 Sought external advice and perspectives: The day after, I Googled ""What to do after a layoff"", and came across so many good resources, articles, and podcasts that helped me shift the narrative in my head and take things less personally. One that I found particularly inspiring: https://lnkd.in/gyy6xBys 🌳 Tended to my mind, body, and soul: For me, this looked like: hiking, yoga, calls with friends and family, journaling, volunteering and getting more active in my community. These activities helped me stay in the present instead of spiraling and ruminating.🤝 Nurtured existing professional relationships: I took this outreach in my own hands to say goodbye to ex-coworkers I had enjoyed working with. Quite a few folks didn't even know that I had been let go, and were immediately supportive. I ultimately left these conversations feeling like I had some closure and that I had made a positive impact, regardless of the unfortunate outcome.👯‍♂️ Created new relationships: Set up coffee dates and attended a few networking events with the intention to just get out there and keep the momentum going. People were super willing to help, sharing ideas and connections along the way.💪 Prepared for the future: Applied for unemployment, spruced up my resume, set up time with a career coach.A layoff is never a fun experience, but it's manageable setback in terms of life experiences, and in the end, you'll come out better in the long run.

147,"    A gente dedica tanto tempo a se desenvolver tecnicamente que às vezes esquece de algo igualmente importante: fazer amigos no trabalho. Eu sei que muita gente diz que ""não tá aqui pra fazer amigos, tá aqui pra trabalhar"". Mas, olha, se for pra passar 8h por dia com a minha equipe, eu quero, sim, ser amiga do povo. Eu quero saber como eles tão, eu quero ajudar e ser ajudada por eles, eu quero rir junto, eu quero reclamar junto, eu quero ir pro bar e pro cinema, quero apresentar meu marido e conhecer a família deles. Eu quero me sentir bem perto deles e quero que eles se sintam bem perto de mim.Minha empresa passou por layoff há alguns meses, depois insolvência e, por fim, falência, recentemente. Tantas coisas difíceis aconteceram. Durante esse tempo, teve momentos em que a gente não tinha certeza se/quanto o salário ia atrasar. Alguns não tinham nenhuma reserva financeira (morar na gringa tem dessas coisas), outros não sabiam quanto tempo poderiam ficar no país legalmente até conseguirem um novo emprego. Os estrangeiros, particularmente, sofreram com informações desencontradas, difíceis de entender; regras, muitas vezes absolutamente inflexíveis, que não tão na internet e precisam ser discutidas em alemão com algum órgão do governo; prazos extremamente apertados; exigências de papéis e mais papéis.Mas, ja dizia o ditado, quem tem um amigo tem tudo. Quando a gente tá longe da família e de toda nossa rede de segurança, são os amigos do trabalho quem mantêm a gente de pé (e aqui, eu queria estender isso também pros amigos que fiz no LinkedIn). Durante todo esse caos, eu tive o prazer de ver e viver as demonstrações de carinho mais lindas. Gente oferecendo dinheiro emprestado pra quem não tinha reservas financeiras (!!); oferecendo o endereço postal pra quem tava fora do país (na Alemanha, não ler uma carta pode ter repercussões sérias); ajudando a galera a se recolocar e fazendo recomendações; se oferecendo pra acompanhar nas visitas a órgãos do governo pra fazer tradução; e muitas mais atitudes incríveis que nem cabem nesse post. Que prazer enorme é saber que, apesar de o trabalho ter acabado, esses amigos vão ficar nas nossas vidas. Que a gente ainda vai rir muito juntos, vai pro bar, vai mandar memes, vai acompanhar o desenvolvimento um do outro, vai poder ajudar e vai ter pra quem pedir ajuda quando apertar. Essa família longe de casa foi, definitivamente, a melhor coisa que a Alemanha me trouxe. E eu contei tudo isso pra deixar aqui meus dois centavos: desenvolva relacionamentos genuínos no trabalho (em qualquer lugar, na verdade).

148,"    There is risk with joining a start-up, one that I knew when leaving my previous position with a stable, privately-owned company earlier this year.  Unfortunately, my time at the start-up came to an early end due to layoffs.  I made a quick decision to go to the #gnydm this week to network and hopefully uncover some opportunities.  One question I was asked a lot, ""What do you want to do next?"" With so many types of organizations, development of new roles and changing market dynamics, I can't answer that easily or quickly.  But what I do know is this:1. I love building teams and I have learned from all the rock-stars that I've had the opportunity to manage in the past.2. Marketing is my wheelhouse, but I love being engaged in sales and partner opportunities and helping put all the collective pieces together within an organization.3.  I thrive when the work I am doing can positively impact an organization's growth or reformation.4.  Start-ups aren't ruled out, I will just seek to be better informed if another opportunity presents itself.5.  Dental has been my world most of the past 13 years, but it's not my only interest.  Purpose-driven organizations are my jam.6.  Culture is Queen!  If you value your employees and support them and their journey, the organization wins.

199,"    *200 years ago it was coal, 100 years ago it was oil, today it is Data that defines geopolitics (and investments).*Let me talk to you about the trigger for this post, Movistar's Devils series, particularly season 2. A little synopsis: London, 2016. Massimo Ruggero is now CEO and, with new COO Wu Zhi, has made huge profits for NYL's Chinese shareholders. However, the polling data on the Brexit referendum threatens total disaster. Taking advantage of the situation, Dominic returns and asks Massimo to join him in a new global war between the West and China for control of world data. Massimo will have to decide whose side he is on in a life-threatening battle that will lead to a showdown in 2020, amid the pandemic.Therefore, we see that the behavior of the East and the West are destined to control the input of the 4th industrial revolution, Data. And whoever can generate, manage, model, and monetize the data faster will have an economic, political (or probably social) advantage, confirming a long-cycle Kondratiev process. This game has been defined several decades ago, and today it could be at the climax of its process.For this reason, in Dominic's words, investments should be focused on Data's M&A processes. Because, in this scenario, companies are only the support of that Data. Those that best generate and manage differentiated data will be the determinants of value in the 21st century.#data #china #investments #oil #Eest #West #geopolitics #Kondratiev #finance #mergers #acquisitions  ","             UTM whisperer.

206,"    HR Leaders have become the dumping ground for the collective angst from the company. They insulate the CEO and other leaders from the emotional intensity. Many have propped up the mood  colleagues and managed to wear a lot of the burden of pandemic and post-pandemic plans on their shoulders. It fascinates me that they kept it together so well - but is there a breaking point of this pressure?What if HR quits? What if after playing referee between team members, assisting people with going on stress leave, and listening to complaint after complaint, they say screw it - I'm outta here?
